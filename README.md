#CKEditor Moono Theme

This theme is a dark version of Moono Theme which originally was designed and developed as a <a href="http://ckeditor.com/blog/ckeditor-4-skin-contest">CKEditor skin contest</a> entry. However, they picked light version and introduced **Chameleon** feature which works really great but not for all colors.

This repository includes new UI color, icons (+hidpi) and CSS files.

If you want to adjust moono theme, you have to switch to the `source` branch.

###How to install
1. Clone / Download this repository and copy `moono-dark` into `ckeditor/skins`
2. Set the new skin name inside your `config.js`:

```js
config.skin = 'moono-dark';
```

Enjoy the beauty of dark UI.
